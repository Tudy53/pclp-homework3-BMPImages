                                                 Homework  3
                                             Image processing


        Task 1: I solved the first task using a few fixed steps and finding the required data with the help
    edit, save, quit functions, depending on the order requirement. The "edit" function reads the path to the file ce
    is to be edited, opening it and, using read_bmp, read, one by one, the components: File Header,
    Info Header and BitMap. The "save" function reads the path to the file to be edited, opening it and
    save and overwrite, adding padding bits. The "quit" function unallocates, using freeBMP, accessing, on
    respectively, the components: File Header, Info Header, BitMap, the matrix and the image itself.

        Task 2: The second task is solved using the "insert" function, the path to the file is read
    is to be inserted and the position of the bottom left corner of the image to be inserted is entered from the keyboard,
    in relation to the image already given. The insertion takes place recursively, depending on the ratio between heights and widths
    the two images.


        Task 3: I solved the third task using a few fixed steps and finding the required data with the help of functions
    "set" and "draw", depending on the order requirement. The "set" function reads the color and thickness of the pencil from the keyboard.
    The "draw" function draws the line, the sides of the triangle or the rectangle depending on the requirement and the dimensions
    data.

        Task 4: I solved the last task using the given pixel and its neighbors of the same color in the pencil color,
    initialized with "set draw_color", only if the initial pixel has a color different from the color of the pencil.
    The process is recursive, thus repeating itself for its neighbors, until the end of the program.
